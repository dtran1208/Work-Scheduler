# Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day during standard business hours (9AM to 5PM). The Work Day Scheduler allows you to add events to time blocks and saves them in the browser's localStorage. Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
